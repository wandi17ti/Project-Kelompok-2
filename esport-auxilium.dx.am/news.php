Evil Geniuses team that is able to come out as champions did appear very dominant from the phase of the Group by successfully occupy the first position with a record 7-3. They only lost to the Fnatic team and drew with the Let â€Ÿs Do It team. That way they went straight into the Upper Bracket Finals and faced the 2nd VGJ.Storm team, but Evil Geniuses team was able to defeat the VGJ.Storm team with a landslide where the first match lasted only 16 minutes and the second for 35 minutes .<br>

International Olympic Committee Forming Official E-Sports For the 2024 Olympics?</h2>
<img src="image/news3.jpg" class="w3-padding-64">
<p class="w3-justify">
The International Olympic Committee established an official E-Sports body to establish communications and agreements between Olympic organizations and the E-Sports industry worldwide.<br>
With the inclusion of 6 E-Sports branches namely Arena of Valor, Clash Royale, Hearthstone, League of Legends, Pro Evolution Soccer and Starcraft II into ASIAN GAMES 2018, although the demonstrations seem to have a major impact on the international scene.<br>
<br>
Then the development of E-Sports from day to day and so high enthusiasts and fans make E-Sports is no longer underestimated. In 2017, E-Sports managed to reach a total audience of 250 million people and is estimated to gain a profit of 700 million dollars or about 10 trillion rupiah.<br>
<br>
Finally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) decided to form an E-Sports body set up to communicate potential cooperation between the Olympics and the owners of E-Sports teams, Organizer E- Sports, as well as the owners of Games that are classified as E-Sports today.</p>

<img src="image/news4.jpg" class="w3-padding-64">
<p class="w3-justify">
According to news circulating most likely E-Sports will be tested at the 2024 Olympics where the French state will host. As we all know, France has enough E-Sports and even has teams supported by the organization there. For example PSG which now has Dota 2 team is PSG.LGD, then there is G2 Esports based in France. Maybe 2024 will be the right momentum for E-Sports to enter the Olympics.<br>
<br>
But for the moment we can already enjoy the E-Sports match in ASIAN GAMES 2018 which will start on August 18, 2018 until 2 September 2018 later.</p>

Team Liquid Successfully Beat Team Made In Brazil On First Day ELEAGUE CS: Premier GO</h2>
<img src="image/news5.jpg" class="w3-padding-64">
<p class="w3-justify">
Team Liquid beat Team Made In Brazil with a score of 2-0 on the first day of the ELEAGUE CS: GO Premier event even though the MIBR team has been reinforced by Pull "Pull" Celik.<br>
<br>
Although Team Liquid played poorly at the ESL One Cologne 2018 event which made them have to come out fast and just take the last position, but it seems they are better prepared for ELEAGUE CS: GO Premier by beating the MIBR team on the first day. And in the ESL One Cologne 2018 MIBR team is able to reach 7-8 large and also they pull Pull "pull" Celik from Cloud9 team to replace Ricardo "boltz" Prass.<br>
<br>
This game uses the BO3 system with the first Map in Inferno which is the choice of the Made In Brazil team. In this Map look once Team Liquid played very well and compact where for some reason MIBR team individually and team does not look prominent and unified with Marcelo 'coldzera' David only able to record 10 Kill and 20 Death. With a good game from Nick 'nitr0' Cannella who recorded 23 Kill, Team Liquid managed to secure the first Map with a score of 16-8.<br>
<br>
Then in the second Map, Cache, which is the preferred Map from Team Liquid, again the MIBR team failed to perform well. This can be seen with the considerable Kill difference where Russel "Twistzz" Van Dulken and Keith "NAF" Markovic were able to get a total of 53 Kills while for the MIBR team only recorded a total of 38 Kills from their 2 best players in Map Cache ie Fernando 'fer' Alvarenga and Gabriel 'FalleN' Toledo.</p>

<img src="image/news6.jpg" class="w3-padding-64">
<p class="w3-justify">Pulling "pull" Celik, who had just entered the MIBR team, was unable to do much and only ranked 4th in the team with 11 Kill and 19 Death danm in the last sequence, Jake 'Stewie2K' Yip 11 Kill and 18 Death. That way the MIBR team will face the Cloud9 team to determine who will be eliminated immediately from this tournament. That means the pull will be against his former team-mates in the live dead party later on.<br>
<br>
For Team Liquid they will meet with the Astralis team to determine which team will immediately qualify for the Playoffs phase. The match between Team Liquid and Astralis will take place on July 24, 2018, at 01.00 WIB (Early Days) while the Made In Brazil and Cloud9 teams will compete on July 25, 2018, at 01.00 WIB (Early Days).
